# DevQ: Build Job Orchestration System

In an enterprise environment, multiple developers collaborate across repositories, each containing numerous branches and features. The infrastructure leverages a CI/CD pipeline where code commits trigger automated build processes.

## Objective
Design **DevQ**, a distributed build system that implements listeners for code commits and manages build jobs across a pool of build runners, handling binary generation and compilation.

---

## System Requirements

### Build Process
- **Primary Trigger**: Code commits.
- **Pipeline Flow**:
  - Source distribution.
  - Build script execution, configuration, and compilation.
  - Packaging and binary compilation.
- **Artifact Support**:
  - Binaries, containers, and packages.

### Resource Orchestration
- **Job Distribution**:
  - Allocate runners dynamically and schedule jobs efficiently.
  - Monitor and manage runner statuses.
- **Concurrency Management**:
  - Handle concurrent build requests effectively.

### Additional Considerations
- Support for priority levels across jobs.
- Ensuring system scalability and fault tolerance.

---

## System Design Components

### 1. **Event Listener**
- Listens for code commit events from repositories.
- Publishes build job requests to a queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

### 2. **Job Queue**
- Stores build jobs and ensures jobs are processed in the correct order.
- Allows for prioritization based on job importance.

### 3. **Build Runner Pool**
- A dynamic pool of build runners for job execution.
- Each runner handles:
  - Code compilation.
  - Binary/package generation.
  - Reporting build status/results.

### 4. **Job Scheduler**
- Assigns jobs to available runners.
- Supports prioritization and concurrency limits.

### 5. **Monitoring & Logging**
- Tracks runner status (idle, busy, offline).
- Logs build statuses and errors for debugging.

---

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Concurrency Management**
- Implement worker pools and load balancers for high throughput.
- Use distributed queues to handle spikes in requests.

### 2. **Scalability**
- Design for horizontal scaling by adding more runners.
- Use cloud services (e.g., Kubernetes) for orchestration.

### 3. **Fault Tolerance**
- Retry mechanism for failed builds.
- Graceful degradation when a runner fails.

### 4. **Priority Scheduling**
- Implement weighted queues for high-priority jobs.
- Ensure low-priority jobs are not starved.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to the repository.
2. **DevQ**'s Event Listener detects the commit and triggers a build job.
3. The Job Scheduler assigns the job to an idle runner.
4. The Build Runner executes the job and uploads the artifacts.
5. Status is logged, and results are reported back to the developer.

---

## Technologies to Consider
- **Event Listener**: Webhooks, AWS Lambda.
- **Queue System**: Kafka, RabbitMQ.
- **Build Runners**: Docker containers, Jenkins agents.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Nomad.

## Open Questions
- How should we handle security for sensitive builds?
- Should **DevQ** support multi-cloud runners?
- How do we optimize build times for large repositories?
